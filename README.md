## Essence (Updated Version)

This is a **more recent version of Essence**, created closer to the end of the project.  

The previous source I shared represents something closer to the conclusion of an older project (*Evolution*), which eventually led to Essence.

ðŸ“Œ In the README of the **older Essence version**, I left a very important message.  
If you havenâ€™t read it yet, I strongly recommend checking it out â€” it reflects much of what I learned during the process.
